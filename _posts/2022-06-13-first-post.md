hello im zoe lol
30 may 2022 - i learnt how to use the laser printer so that i could print the lightbox pieces and assembly them together. Also started learning about github and how to create website.
31 May 2022- i did not go to work as i had CCA from 8-11am 
1 June 2022 - i continued to assemble the lightbox and print more of the parts needed
